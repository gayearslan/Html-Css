        <p>
            Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.

            Ingredients
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 eggs
            </li>
            <li>
                1tbs butter
            </li>
            <li>
                2tbs cream
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Method
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat
            </li>
            <li>
                Gendy mix the eggs and cream in a bowl
            </li>
            <li>
                Once butter has melted add cream and eggs
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan
                to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making a omelette)
            </li>
            <li>
                When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)
            </li>
        </ol>
